TASK: Analyze and reorganize this codebase for better separation of concerns and AI-editability.

BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES, perform these steps:

1. **INVENTORY**: List all files, their line counts, and primary responsibilities
2. **IDENTIFY ISSUES**:
   - Files over 300 lines
   - Functions/classes with multiple responsibilities
   - Tightly coupled components
   - Circular dependencies
   - Dead code or orphaned functions from prior refactoring

3. **PROPOSE STRUCTURE**: Create a reorganization plan following these rules:
   - Target 150-300 lines per file maximum
   - One primary concern per file
   - Group by feature/domain, not by type
   - Each module should have a clear public interface
   - Minimize cross-file dependencies
   - Name files to clearly indicate their single purpose

4. **PRESENT PLAN**: Show me:
   - Proposed directory structure
   - Which code moves where
   - New files to create
   - Files to split and how
   - Interfaces/contracts between modules

5. **WAIT FOR APPROVAL** before making any file changes

CONSTRAINTS:
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Maintain git-trackable atomic changes
- Create clear module boundaries with explicit imports/exports
- Each file should be understandable in isolation with minimal context
- Prioritize loose coupling over DRY if they conflict
